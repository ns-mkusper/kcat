Description: generic producer and consumer for Apache Kafka
 kafkacat is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache Kafka
 0.8, think of it as a netcat for Kafka.
 .
 In producer mode kafkacat reads messages from stdin, delimited with a
 configurable delimeter and produces them to the provided Kafka
 cluster, topic and partition. In consumer mode kafkacat reads messages
 from a topic and partition and prints them to stdout using the
 configured message delimiter.
 .
 kafkacat also features a Metadata list mode to display the current
 state of the Kafka cluster and its topics and partitions.
